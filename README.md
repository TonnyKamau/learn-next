## Learning Next.js with the App Router and Daisy UI

This project is focused on learning Next.js 13+ with the new App Router, while also incorporating Daisy UI for streamlined UI development. Here are some key aspects we're exploring:

1. **App Router**: We're using Next.js' new App Router, which provides a more intuitive and powerful way to handle routing in your application.

2. **Daisy UI**: We've integrated Daisy UI, a plugin for Tailwind CSS, to speed up our UI development process with pre-built components and utility classes.

3. **Server Components**: We're leveraging Next.js 13's server components for improved performance and SEO.

4. **API Routes**: Exploring how to create and use API routes within the App Router structure.

5. **Styling**: Combining Tailwind CSS with Daisy UI for efficient and consistent styling across the application.

6. **Theming**: Utilizing Daisy UI's built-in themes for easy customization and consistent design across the project.

To get started with Daisy UI in this project, make sure to install it and configure it in your `tailwind.config.js` file. You can then use Daisy UI classes and components throughout your Next.js application.

Daisy UI comes with a variety of pre-built themes that are compatible with its components. These themes make it easy to customize the look and feel of your application without writing extensive CSS. You can switch between themes or create your own to match your project's design requirements.
